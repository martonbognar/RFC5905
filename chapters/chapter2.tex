\chapter{Modes of Operation}
\label{section-2}

An NTP implementation operates as a primary server, secondary server,
or client. A primary server is synchronized to a reference clock
directly traceable to UTC (e.g., GPS, Galileo, etc.). A client
synchronizes to one or more upstream servers, but does not provide
synchronization to dependent clients. A secondary server has one or
more upstream servers and one or more downstream servers or clients.
All servers and clients who are fully NTPv4-compliant MUST implement
the entire suite of algorithms described in this document. In order
to maintain stability in large NTP subnets, secondary servers SHOULD
be fully NTPv4-compliant. Alternative algorithms MAY be used, but
their output MUST be identical to the algorithms described in this
specification.
